[orange1]Usage[/]

    dbx export [fuchsia]<JOBID>[/] [deepskyblue1][[OPTIONS]][/]

[orange1]Description[/]

    The export command connects to the specified database, runs defined queries on a source table, and exports the data into one of the various supported formats.

[orange1]Arguments[/]

    [fuchsia]JOBID[/]
        A user-defined identifier for the job.
    
[orange1]Options[/]

    [deepskyblue1]--az-storage[/] <[fuchsia]KEY=VALUE[/]>
    
        Properties used to facilitate the upload of data files to an Azure storage account. If specified and valid, data files are uploaded to the specified account as they are written. The following properties are required:
        
        - Account:      The name of the blob storage account. This value is used to construct the blob storage uri.
        - Container:    The container name.
        - SasToken:     If the container is not public and writeable, the SAS token used to authenticate to the service.
        - Path:         Optional path appended to the container uri.
        - Overwrite:    A boolean value indicating whether blobs should be overwritten if they already exist in the container.
        
        [red]Warning:[/] Do not store secrets in script files - use the configuration system instead.                  

    [deepskyblue1]--batch-size[/] <[fuchsia]COUNT[/]>
    
        The maximum number of records to return in a query, defaults to 2500.

    [deepskyblue1]--columns[/] <[fuchsia]COLUMN_LIST[/]>
    
        A comma-separated list of column names found in the source table to include in the output data. This list cannot contain computed column definitions, but it can contain qualifiers if required by the provider. Computed columns can be leveraged by using the --query option.
        
        If this option is not used, and the --query option is not used, all columns in the table are selected using names discovered by the provider's schema query. In all cases except when the --query option is used, columns can be excluded by using the --exclude-columns options.

    [deepskyblue1]--command-retry-policy[/] <[fuchsia]POLICY[/]>
    
        A retry policy definition that describes the intervals at which command (query) attempts are retried. [fuchsia]POLICY[/] is expressed in a command-separated list of second interval values, and the total number of intervals specified equates to the number of attempts the connector will try before throwing a stop exception.
        
        E.g. --command-retry-policy 30,30,30 - causes the connector to retry failed commands 3 times after 30 seconds. 
        
    [deepskyblue1]--compression[/] <[fuchsia]NONE|GZIP[/]>
    
        The compression to enable on output data files. This option is enabled by default with GZIP compression.        

    [deepskyblue1]--connection-prop <[fuchsia]KEY=VALUE[/]> [[...]][/]
        
        Additional vendor-specific properties to use when configuring the database connection. This option can be specified more than once.
        
        E.g. --connection-prop DefaultConnectTimeout=60 - sets the default connection timeout in the MySQL connector.
    
    [deepskyblue1]-c, --connection-string[/] <[fuchsia]CONNECTION_STRING[/]>   
      
        The connection string used to connect to the database. An explicit connection string or a configuration secret can be specified.
        [red]Warning:[/] Do not store secrets in script files - use the configuration system instead.
        
    [deepskyblue1]--connection-retry-policy[/] <[fuchsia]POLICY[/]>
        
        A retry policy definition that describes the intervals at which connection attempts are retried. [fuchsia]POLICY[/] is expressed in a comma-separated list of second interval values, and the total number of intervals specified equates to the number of attempts the connector will try before throwing a stop exception.
        
        E.g. --connection-retry-policy=3,5,5,10,30 - causes the connector to retry failed connections 5 times after 3, 5, 5, 10, and 30 seconds, respectively.
        
    [deepskyblue1]--db, --database[/] <[fuchsia]NAME[/]>
    
        The name of the database to connect to.
        
    [deepskyblue1]--exclude-columns[/] <[fuchsia]COLUMN_LIST[/]>
    
        A comma-separated list of columns to exclude from the output data. This option may be used in conjunction with --columns, but not with --query.
        
    [deepskyblue1]--max-file-count[/] <[fuchsia]COUNT[/]>
    
        The maximum number of records to write to a data file. If specified, this value must be equal to or greater than the batch size. When used in combination with --max-file-size, the smaller result has precedence over the other. 
        
    [deepskyblue1]--max-file-size[/] <[fuchsia]SIZE[/]>
        
        The maximum size of a single output data file. The exporter gets as close to this value as possible using basic heuristics. [fuchsia]SIZE[/] is an integer followed by one of the following units:
        
        B - bytes
        K - kilobytes
        M - megabytes
        G - gigabytes
        
        When used in combination with --max-file-count, the smaller result has precedence over the other.
        
    [deepskyblue1]--no-cache[/]
    
        Disables the persistent cache system. When this switch is specified, query results are staged in memory and not to disk. Note that when using this option, any previously retrieved records not yet written to an output file must be retrieved again from the database if the program is resumed.
        
    [deepskyblue1]--no-resume[/]
    
        Disables resume functionality. By default, the exporter saves its current progress, and if the program is resumed it can continue where it left off. Using this option additionally implies the --no-cache option.                 
    
    [deepskyblue1]--output-format, -f[/] <[fuchsia]CSV|JSON|PARQUET[/]>
    
        The output format in which to write data files. The following formats are supported:
        
        - CSV
        - JSON
        - PARQUET
    
    [deepskyblue1]-o, --output-path[/] <[fuchsia]PATH[/]>
    
        A relative or qualified path where the exporter should place data files. The directory will be created if it doesn't exist.
            
    [deepskyblue1]-p, --password[/] <[fuchsia]SECRET[/]>
            
        The password associated with the user account. This can be a literal value or configuration secret.
        [red]Warning:[/] Do not store secrets in script files - use the configuration system instead.
        
    [deepskyblue1]-q, --query[/] <[fuchsia]STATEMENT[/]>        
        
        The statement used to retrieve table data using provider-specific syntax. Use this option to rename columns with aliases, use computed columns, or specify where clauses.
        Note: Queries cannot have keywords or clauses that affect row ordering (use the --sort-by option instead). A stop exception occurs if encountered.
        
    [deepskyblue1]--schema[/] <[fuchsia]NAME[/]>
    
        The name of the schema that contains the source table being exported.
        
    [deepskyblue1]--sort-by <[fuchsia]COLUMN[/]> [[...]][/]
    
        The name of column or columns that participate in the query sorting operation. This option can be specified more than once, and the columns are ranked in the order in which they are specified in the command.
        
        Note - The sort column definition should use either temporal or incrementing values such that if the program is resumed, duplicate records aren't output as a result. The exporter uses sort-columns to store high-watermark values.
        
    [deepskyblue1]--table[/] <[fuchsia]NAME[/]>
    
        The name of the source table being exported. If the table name must be qualified with a schema, it can be conjoined in this option using the provider's specific syntax, or be specified separately using the --schema option.
        
    [deepskyblue1]--threads[/] <[fuchsia]COUNT[/]>
    
        The maximum number of concurrent query threads to create to execute query commands. Note the .Net scheduler may limit thread usage. The default thread count is 4is used if this option is specified.        
        
    [deepskyblue1]-u, --user[/] <[fuchsia]ID[/]>
    
        The login id of the user account that has the required read access to the database. This can be a literal user id or configuration secret.
